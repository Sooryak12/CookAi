       "'To begin making the homemade baked beans recipe, we first have to soak the beans overnight for about 8 hours in water.We also have to make the cooked tomato puree. Click here to see the recipe of how to make tomato puree at home.Once the beans are soaked well, our next step is to cook them. I like using the pressure cooker method to cook the beans. Place the beans in the pressure, place the weight on, cover the pan and cook it along with 2-1/2 cups of water. After you heat 4 to 5 whistles, turn the heat to low and cook for another 15 minutes.Turn off the heat and allow the pressure cooker to release its pressure naturally. This would take another 10 minutes. The beans continue to cook under the pressure even when it is turned off.Once the pressure is released, open the cooker and drain out the excess liquids. You store this liquid and use it in the vegetable stock or risotto.Once the beans are cooked, our next step is to spice it up to make the baked beans.Heat oil in a sauce pan on medium heat; add in the onions and garlic and give it a light sauté until the onions are tender. Add the tomatoes, honey and the spices and give it a stir.Add in the cooked drained beans into the tomato gravy. Stir fry the beans until the beans get well coated with the tomatoes. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low and simmer the beans for about 30 minutes until you noticed the beans are well coated with the spices and tomatoes. Check the salt and seasoning levels and adjust to suit your taste.You can optionally garnish the Homemade Baked Beans with coriander leaves and serve it along with toast, or Potato Cakes Recipe.'"

       "  \"To begin making soft homemade idli, we will first make the idli batter. Soak the rice in water, such that the all the rice is completely immersed in water. Let it soak for about 6 hours.Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water. Let it soak for about 6 hours.First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter. The batter will look fluffy. Pour this batter into a large container.Grind the rice into a smooth paste, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the dosa batter too watery. If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .The rice batter is a little coarser, but the urad dal batter is super smooth.Combine the urad and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.To make the idlisGrease the idli molds with a little sesame oil. This process is purely optional. I like to do this as it adds to the flavor of the idli’s. Pour spoonfuls of the batter into these moulds.Do make sure you fill the idli batter only half way through as they will rise up to the top when steamed. Once all the plates are filled, place the filled idli racks one above the other making sure the holes are facing the filled portion.Prepare the idli steamer with a little water in the bottom. Place the filled idli racks in the steamer. Place the steamer on high heat and steam the idli’s for 10 minutes.After 10 minutes of steaming, turn off the heat. Open the steamer and insert a knife or a pick to test whether the idli's are cooked. If nothing sticks then the idlis are perfectly steamed.Now you can remove the idli’s from the steamer. Have a small bowl filled with water. Dip a spoon in the water and then scoop the idli's out starting from the edges. Dipping the spoon in water helps in the easy removal of idli from the plates.The wholesome homemade soft idli are now ready to be served for breakfast, lunch or dinner.Serve Classic Homemade Soft Idli with Coconut Chutney, Thakkali Vengayam Sambar, Idli Milagai Podi & Filter Coffee for a delicious breakfast at home. \",\n",

This makes the crepes soft and fluffy.To begin making the crepes, warm a crepe pan with a rim on a medium heat. Butter or oil it evenly. When the pan gets hot, pour just enough batter to cover the base, and start tilting and swirling the pan to spread the batter and make a thin film on the surface of the pan. This film should be as thin as possible, and if there is excess batter pour it back into the jug.Once you make a couple of crepes, you will understand how much batter your need to pour for a single crepe. You could also use a measuring cup to pour the batter, so that way the subsequent times you will get it just right. These crepes gets cooked really quick and you need to cook it just until the bottom begins to get a little golden, then gently lift the edges and flip the crepe to cook on the other side for a few seconds.Transfer the prepared whole wheat crepes to a platter and cover with a dome lid to keep warm and soft. Proceed the same way with the remaining batter and stack the crepes one on top of the other. Serve the crepes as desired.

There are two different ways you can make this pickle.Sun Method for the Chunda PicklePlace the mango mixture in the steel vessel with a rim. Wrap the vessel with muslin or cheesecloth and tie it with a thick thread/lace to fit tightly around the vessel.Keep it under sunlight for about 7 days or until the sugar and jaggery melts and reaches a double string consistency, stirring it well at the end of every day.Bring it back inside once the sun sets.Stir well the next morning and place it under the sun again.Continue this process until the double string consistency has been reached.Stove top method for Chunda PickleHeat a heavy bottomed pan on low heat; add the mango and sugar mixture to the pan and stir continuously until the sugar has dissolved completely.You will find bubbles frothing up on the surface, but continue stirring until the sugar syrup reaches the single string consistency. This takes about 5 to 8 minutes.This step is crucial as over-cooking will make the sugar crystallize later. Remove from the flame and let the mixture cool completely.Continue stirring the chunda pickle while it is cooling occasionally to prevent the sugar from crystallizing. Roast the cumin seeds in the pan until it starts crackling. Coarsely pound it and keep aside.Once the Mango Chunda pickle is cooled completely, stir in the chilli powder and crushed cumin seeds until well combined into the pickle.The Mango Chunda Pickle can be consumed immediately.Store the Mango Chunda Pickle in sterilized glass jars and it will last for about one year without refrigeration.Serve Aam Ka Chunda Recipe with Thelpas or with just about anything on your plate.',\n",

The mixture will resemble a wet crumb texture.With this existing moisture we need to make this into a smooth dough. For that add in a tablespoon of maida (all purpose flour). This flour is to absorb that extra moisture and give it a bit of gluten for the dough. Resist the temptation to add more flour, this will alter the texture of the puri for the pani puriKnead this dough well for about 10 minutes continuously. It will be easier to knead it on your kitchen platform rather than the bowl. You can use both your hands and muscle power to get the sooji rava mixture into a consistency of a smooth dough. The dough should not be super stiff. It should be firm, yet smooth and pliable.NOTE: Do time yourself and knead for 10 minutes and not any less (smiles)The kneading helps the dough develop the gluten and the warmth of your hand helps it get softer. This gluten will help the puri’s puff in the oil and turn crisp as well.Also note, the dough should not be soft, it should be medium tight and not hard. Hence kneading well helps give that smooth finishAfter kneading the dough for 10 minutes, add in 1 tablespoon of oil. It is important that you add the oil only after kneading the dough and not in the beginning. This will give the crunch to the dough that a puri of the pani puri should have.Knead this pani puri dough for another 3 minutes (put a timer on)Now cover the dough either in a box with a lid or invert a bowl over it. This helps the dough to sweat and form its gluten and softness. Allow the dough to rest for at least 30 minutes.Once the dough is well rested for 30 minutes, knead the dough once again for another 2 minutes (set the timer on)Once kneaded, we will now use a cookie cutter or the cap of the cocktail shaker to cut the puri’s for the pani puri.Preheat the oil for deep frying the puri for the pani puri.Divide the dough in 3 small portions. Take one portion out and keep the rest covered. Roll the dough into a thin sheet and using a cutter make rounds of the dough.I like to roll these rounds a little more with a rolling pin just to make sure you get the perfect thickness.Keep adding one puri at a time into the preheat oil and fry the puri’s on low to medium heat (not high heat), until they puff and turn golden brown on both sides.Note: The puri’s have to fry on low to medium heat to get that perfect crispness.Drain the puri’s once they turn golden brown on absorbent paper.Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the dough.Serve these  Puris with Pani to make Pani Puris | Golgappas | Puchka’s the most famous street food snack of india.',\n",
